 ## LESSONS
 In computer science and software development, troubleshooting and debugging are essential abilities. They entail the process of locating, separating, and resolving problems or glitches within an application. This is a more thorough breakdown of debugging and troubleshooting. Beginning with debugging, this website helped me know more about the following stages in debugging. It entails details information and explanations on them.

### DEBUGGING

1.	Identification of Bugs: Finding unexpected behavior or mistakes in software is the first step in debugging. This can be an unexpected result, a broken feature, or a crash.
2.	Reproduction: In order to determine the root cause of the bug, reproduction is essential. This entails formulating a scenario or sequence of actions that inevitably result in the problem.
3.	Using Debugging Tools: Integration development environments (IDEs), logging systems, and debugging tools are used to monitor program execution and pinpoint the program's failure point.
4.	Code Inspection: Debugging essentially involves code inspection, which involves looking for logical mistakes, poor syntax, or misuse of variables and functions in the source code.
5.	Breakpoints: Frequently used by developers, breakpoints allow programs to be stopped at specified points in time. They can now examine the state and variables of the program as a result.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
Troubleshooting is a systematic process of identifying, isolating, and resolving issues within a system, device, or process. It involves diagnosing the root cause of unexpected behavior, malfunctions, or errors, and implementing effective solutions to restore the system to its intended functionality. This practice is common in various technical fields and often requires analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and knowledge of system components and interactions.
1.	Systematic Problem Solving: Identifying and fixing issues in a system in a methodical manner is the larger process of troubleshooting. This could involve hardware, network, or configuration difficulties in addition to software-related ones.
2.	Root Cause Analysis: Troubleshooting seeks to identify the underlying cause of an issue, going beyond its symptoms. To determine the cause of the problem, the entire system must be examined.
3.	Isolation of Components: Disassembling a system into its constituent parts and evaluating each one separately aids in determining which component is the source of the issue.

### FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

The process of front-end development entails designing a website or web application's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). This segment of web development involves direct user interaction. On the client side, front-end developers create and implement a website or application's visual components, layout, and interactivity. A more thorough overview of front-end development may be found here.

#### Markup Language, or HTML:
Framework: A web page's content is organized using HTML, which is the primary markup language. Basic elements including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links are defined.

#### HTML Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):
Presentation: Layout and styling are done using CSS. The way HTML components are displayed visually, including their colors, fonts, spacing, and placement, can be changed by developers.
The ability to create designs that are responsive to varying screen sizes and devices is facilitated by CSS.

#### JavaScript :
JavaScript is a programming language that allows for client-side dynamic interactivity. Programmers can utilize it to design interactive and responsive user interfaces.
JavaScript is utilized for event handling, which allows it to provide a response to user inputs like clicks and form submissions.
